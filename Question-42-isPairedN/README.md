an array is defined to be paired-N if it contains two distinct elements that sum to N for some specified value of N and the indexes of those elements also sum to N. write a function named isPairedN that returns 1 if its array parameter is paired-N array. the value of N is passed as the second parameter. solve it in java. 

for example if 
1. a = { 1,4,1,4,5,6 } and n = 5, the it will return 1 because a[2]+a[3] = 5 and 2+3 = 5
2. a = { 1,4,1,4,5,6 } and n = 6, the it will return 1 because a[2]+a[4] = 6 and 2+4 = 6
3. a = { 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 } and n = 6, the it will return 1 because a[1]+a[5] = 6 and 1+5 = 6
